A. About
	dSipCom is SIP audio/ video communicator software written with QT4 UI
	This program is free software licensed on LGPL public license.
	Program author: Daniel (dmilith) Dettlaff ( dmilith at gmail.com )

B. Prepare to compile
    0. What do You need?
	qt4-dev-tools ( 4.4.X Cause You just don't want to compile it by Yourself.. it may take whole day )
	libboost-filesystem-dev ( boost filesystem libraries )
	libboost-date-time-dev ( boost date-time libraries )

C. Installing precompiled libs ( in src/external/debs_lenny_amd64 )
    0. You have already precompiled libraries for Debian Lenny amd64 arch.
    1. Install them via apt-get/ aptitude/ synaptic
	You need to put line similar to this one to your /etc/apt/sources.list:
	deb file:/full/path/to/dsipcom/src/debs_lenny_amd64/ ./
	then apt-get update
	then install dSipCom versions of packages:
	ffmpeg gsm libexosip2 libosip2 libspeex1 linphone
	
    2. Install them manually:
	cd your/path/to/dsipcom/src/external/debs_lenny_amd64
	sudo dpkg -i *.deb
	
    3. Proceed to compilation of dSipCom source ( just exec src/Make_all )
	You're done!

D. Creating necessary libs ( from sources )
    0. Set compiler flags:
	export CFLAGS="-march=athlon64 -Os" ( for amd64 arch and with optimize )
    1. Download and compile speex
	http://www.speex.org/downloads/
	cd speex-1.2beta3o2
	./configure --enable-shared
	make
	sudo make install

    2. Download and compile ffmpeg
	git clone git://git.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/
	cd ffmpeg
	git clone git://git.mplayerhq.hu/libswscale/
	( or svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg )

        ./configure --enable-shared
        make
        sudo make install

	cd libswscale
	make
	sudo make install

    3. Download and compile linphone from cvs
	cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/sources/linphone co linphone
	cd linphone-cvs
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-shared
	make
	sudo make install
